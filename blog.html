	<p>Nowadays any calculations and processing made on a Hadoop (and not only) cluster
		can be viewed as procesing batches of data. The size of the batches is
		significant. As batches go smaller, their arrive time becomes smaller and at
		some point we process such a data at almost online speed. So at some place small
		portion of data appears, and as it is small it can be transferred to processing
		point quickly, thus processing can be held immediately.</p>
